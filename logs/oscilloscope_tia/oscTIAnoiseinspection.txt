60Hz & odd harmonics dominate TIA input

BUT - lots of HF noise ~MHz that seems to be injected from the connection to Teensy through ground
    Ground node (both sides) oscillates a ton. Maybe it's worth low-passing the two?
    Plots of this as well.

60Hz dominates by about 20dB. Hopefully ok?

Seems to be coming in through digital interface. Disappears when not plugged in
    -Commenting out everything in sampleCurrent does nothing

Can see digital noise (SPI communication with TIA) as bumps in TIA output. But not dominant noise source

Better measurements:
    With  (piezo, TIA) serial links enabled
        noise: 56mV
        signal: 3mV
    With no serial links enabled
        noise: nothing
        signal: 3mV

    serial links are the problem :(

    confirmed, see noise only at serial accesses. sad.
        now where's noise coming from?

Added a shield - Al foil around TIA cable, metal sheet between control assembly and enclosure. This seemed to knock RMS noise down by a factor of ~2
